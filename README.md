# Project Description
A telecom operator company, Megaline, offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. As an analyst in the company, the commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.  

### Description of the plans
Note: Megaline rounds seconds up to minutes, and megabytes to gigabytes. For calls, each individual call is rounded up: even if the call lasted just one second, it will be counted as one minute. For web traffic, individual web sessions are not rounded up. Instead, the total for the month is rounded up. If someone uses 1025 megabytes this month, they will be charged for 2 gigabytes.
